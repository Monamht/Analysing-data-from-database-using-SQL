# SQL Data Analysis on Ecommerce Dataset
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an Ecommerce SQL Database using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. The queries extract insights on shipment patterns, customer ratings, warehouse performance, and delivery efficiency. The analysis helps understand logistics efficiency, customer behavior, and risk factors affecting deliveries.

# Dataset
The dataset (ESD table) contains details on customer transactions, including shipment mode, warehouse block, product importance, customer ratings, discounts, delivery statuses, and more.

# SQL Queries & Analysis
# 1️⃣ Data Integrity Checks
Duplicate Value Check: Identifies duplicate IDs to ensure data consistency.

# 2️⃣ Warehouse & Shipment Analysis
Warehouse Block Distribution: Analyzes product distribution across different blocks.

Shipment Mode Analysis: Evaluates how orders are shipped and identifies the most-used shipment modes.

# 3️⃣ Customer Insights
Customer Rating Distribution: Understands customer feedback trends.

Product Importance Analysis: Examines product categorization based on importance.

Gender-Based Analysis: Analyzes purchase distribution across gender.

# 4️⃣ Delivery Performance & Risk Analysis
On-Time vs. Late Deliveries: Provides insights into delayed shipments.

Average Discount Impact on Delivery: Analyzes how discount offerings influence delivery time.

Average Product Cost by Delivery Status: Determines cost variations between timely vs. delayed deliveries.

High-Risk Warehouse Blocks: Identifies blocks with higher delay percentages.

Shipment Mode with Most Delays: Finds which shipment mode contributes most to late deliveries.

Customer Care Calls & Delays: Studies if frequent calls indicate potential delays.

Prior Purchases Impact: Evaluates how previous transactions affect shipment time.

# 5️⃣ Correlation Analysis
Discounts vs. Delays: Investigates how discounts correlate with delivery time.

Cost vs. Rating: Determines if higher product costs lead to better ratings.

Average Rating by Warehouse: Identifies warehouse blocks with better-rated deliveries.

# 6️⃣ Advanced Analysis
Delays by Shipment Mode: Compares delay percentages among different shipping methods.
Combining Shipment Mode & Product Importance: Examines whether product importance affects delivery speed.
